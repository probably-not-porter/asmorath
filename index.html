        <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
        <p1>
            <span class="bigletter">T</span>he planet of Asmorath was home to a variety of different cultures and peoples,
            all of whom respected and drew strength from the bountiful lands upon which
            they lived. It was a utopia of seemingly endless resources and none went hungry.
            They had mastered metallurgy and harnessed the power of their geothermal
            and electric power that the planet produced in plenty. There are many
            powerful terramancers (Magic users who get their innate power from the leylines
            and power sinks throughout the various lands). Those who do not have the gift
            of terramancy develop infrastructure using their advanced science and
            engineering skills to channel the power of the land to develop infrastructure
            and to create buildings and machines to better the lives of their fellow
            Asmorathians.

            A ship of “missionary” colonizers from the galactic empire of Vorathia,
            discovered their planet while scouring their sector for new planets to
            occupy. They quickly attempted to claim the planet and neglected to notify
            their superiors, hoping to keep the resources and people as servants and
            slaves for themselves.
        </p2>
        <br>
        <p1>
            The people of Asmorath are a wholesome and caring people who had no concept of
            ownership, only mutual aid and social support so they welcomed the Vorathians
            and gladly shared their resources with the visitors. The Vorathians were not
            satisfied however. They signed treaties with the Asmorathians claiming larger
            and larger portions of the planet and claiming ownership of their existing
            infrastructure and workplaces siphoning off the resources they produced.
        </p1>
        <br>
        <p1>
            When the Vorathians began killing any Asmorathians who resisted their
            increasing domination as a show of force and out of fear of their magical
            connection to the world, revolution and insurrection began fomenting among
            the Asmorathians. The greed of the Vorathians left them in a precarious
            position because if they ask for aid from Emperor Perrian now, they would be
            admitting they attempted to steal the land and resources from the empire. The
            unrest in Asmorath is now reaching a boiling point. They need only a strong
            leader with a formidable mind for strategy to coordinate their revolution.
