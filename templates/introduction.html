        <span class="bigletter">T</span>he planet of Asmorath was home to a variety of different cultures and peoples, 
        all of whom respected and drew strength from the bountiful lands upon which 
        they lived. It was a utopia of seemingly endless resources and none went hungry. 
        They had mastered metallurgy and harnessed the power of their geothermal 
        and electric power that the planet produced in plenty. There are many 
        powerful terramancers (Magic users who get their innate power from the leylines 
        and power sinks throughout the various lands). Those who do not have the gift 
        of terramancy develop infrastructure using their advanced science and 
        engineering skills to channel the power of the land to develop infrastructure 
        and to create buildings and machines to better the lives of their fellow 
        Asmorathians.

        A ship of “missionary” colonizers from the galactic empire of Vorathia, 
        discovered their planet while scouring their sector for new planets to 
        occupy. They quickly attempted to claim the planet and neglected to notify 
        their superiors, hoping to keep the resources and people as servants and 
        slaves for themselves.

        The people of Asmorath are a wholesome and caring people who had no concept of 
        ownership, only mutual aid and social support so they welcomed the Vorathians 
        and gladly shared their resources with the visitors. The Vorathians were not 
        satisfied however. They signed treaties with the Asmorathians claiming larger 
        and larger portions of the planet and claiming ownership of their existing 
        infrastructure and workplaces siphoning off the resources they produced.

        When the Vorathians began killing any Asmorathians who resisted their 
        increasing domination as a show of force and out of fear of their magical 
        connection to the world, revolution and insurrection began fomenting among 
        the Asmorathians. The greed of the Vorathians left them in a precarious 
        position because if they ask for aid from Emperor Perrian now, they would be 
        admitting they attempted to steal the land and resources from the empire. The 
        unrest in Asmorath is now reaching a boiling point. They need only a strong 
        leader with a formidable mind for strategy to coordinate their revolution.
